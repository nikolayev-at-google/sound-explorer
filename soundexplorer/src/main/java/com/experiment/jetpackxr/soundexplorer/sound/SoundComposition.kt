/**
 * Sound Composition - Represents a musical composition created by a SoundExplorer user.
 *
 * To build a composition, a user may add sound objects to their environment.
 * Each sound object has a low and a high sound sample associated with it.
 * Users may play / pause individual sound objects or the entire composition at any time.
 *
 * All sound samples are loaded as separate instances of SpatialAudioTrack. Once loaded, all sound
 * samples are played at the same time and simply allowed to loop forever after that.
 * When a user plays and stops sounds, we just toggle the volume of it's respective audio track
 * between 0.0 and 1.0. We did this for simplicity and to maintain synchronization between different
 * sounds.
